# Slim Variant - Magnetic Cases for the Typeractive Corne

## Introduction

The slim variant of the magnetic cases for the Typeractive Corne is designed for minimalism and portability. The Slim Variant utilizes a smaller 110mAh battery. The case thickness is 16mm, and the carrying case measures 17.25mm. Please note, the Slim Variant is incompatible with display covers (e.g., the Typeractive Corne Display Cover available at typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover) to maintain its sleek profile.

## Instructions

1) Print all the needed parts either with your own printer or a printing service. 

    **Printing Instructions:**
    - No Supports are needed for any of the parts.
    - A .16 layer height is recommended for the keyboard case and carrying case (although any layer height should work).
    - An infill percentage between 30-50 percent is recommended for the keyboard case and carrying case, (any infill percentage should work however 30-50 makes the prints feel more sturdy, if you wish to make it sturdier print at an infill percentage higher than 50 at the cost of time and materials).
    - Make sure to orient the carrying case so that the flat side is facing down, the walls should be facing up.
    - When printing the wrist rest an infill percentage of 50% and higher is recommended, this is due to the incline of the wrist rest, lower infill percentages can lead to artifacting on the incline. A higher infill percentage also makes the wrist rest feel sturdier. (I personally print it at 80% infill).
    - When printing the wrist rest choose a smaller layer height of between .08 and .12 this is so that the incline is more natural and has less bumps. (I personally print it at .08 layer height) If your printing software allows for variable layer heights I recommend that option for the wrist rest (ex. Bambu lab).

2) Prepare a safe space to glue your magnets into their holes. You may want to use a piece of parchment paper to prevent glue from getting on your surface. I suggest wearing disposable gloves during the process.

3) Starting with the keyboard case and using a small tip for your super glue, insert a few drops into a hole and push the magnet inside, be careful not to have the other magnets nearby as they may push the magnet out of the hole, try and avoid getting glue on the plastic, if it does occur quick use a paper towel to dab it up. Allow each magnet to sit for about 20 seconds before moving onto the next one. Continue until all the magnets are inserted.  Tip: It is possible to use the other magnets on the outside of the keyboard case to move the magnet into the hole, insert one magnet in the keyboard case, and use a stack of magnets to guide it into the hole.

4) Now one by one place your magnets on the outside of the keyboard case, there are 19 magnets in the case so you should have 15 on the outside. Skip placing corresponding magnets to the 4 on the bottom middle of the keyboard case (the only side of the keyboard case with 4 magnets and are placed very close to each other), these are used exclusively for the wrist rest and will be used later. Each one of your 15 magnets should align with a magnet on the interior.

5) Now grab the corresponding sides carrying case (right and right or left and left) and position it in the same orientation as the keyboard case so that the magnet positions align. It is very important that it is aligned properly so you understand which corresponding magnet should go where. Now one by one grab magnets off of the keyboard case and place them into their corresponding hole on the carrying case (the outer side of the magnet facing away from the keyboard case when attached should be facing the interior of the carrying case magnet hole so that they are attracted to each other) It is very important to pay attention here and make sure you don't switch any of the magnet directions by accident. A failure in direction could mean having to go through the process again if it won't come out.

6) Allow all the magnets to set and make sure to complete both the left and right side. It is a very similar process for the wrist rest. Place 10 magnets on the bottom exterior of the keyboard case, making sure each one aligns with a magnet on the interior. Then position your wrist rest in the same orientation as the keyboard case making sure it aligns, and follow the same process of taking the magnets and gluing them into their corresponding holes on the wrist rest. The outer side of the magnet facing away from the keyboard case when attached should be facing the interior of the wrist rest magnet hole so that they are attracted to each other. It is very important to pay attention here and make sure you don't switch any of the magnet directions by accident. A failure in direction could mean having to go through the process again if it won't come out. Tip: Be careful when placing the 4 magnets that are close together on one side, due to their closeness, placing the 4 consecutively can lead to the magnets flying out as the glue is setting. To alleviate this, hold down the magnet while the glue is setting. Don't glue those 4 consecutively; take your time and allow each one to set before placing the next. Arranging the poles so that they are alternating also seems to help but is not necessary (i.e., 1st North facing out, 2nd South facing out, 3rd North Facing out, 4th South Facing out).

7) The hard part is over now that your magnets are all inserted. We can now install the keyboard. First, install the standoffs. There are 5 holes in the base of the keyboard case, insert an M2 screw in each one from the bottom and screw on the M2 standoff. Place the completed PCB (ensure the PCB is built completely) on top of the standoffs and screw the keyboard in with 5 M2 screws.

8) At this point, your keyboard is ready to go. Try out all the magnetic parts and make sure everything is working and looks good. Ensure you have sufficient magnetic strength between the keyboard case and carrying case. If there isn't enough strength, assuming you used the magnets recommended, you most likely have a magnet facing the wrong way. If you can't get it out of the hole, you may need to redo that specific part.

9) If you wish to install a leather sheet on top of your wrist rest, make your way over to the Flattened Wrist Rest Shape Print Out page [here](https://github.com/MateoBodon/Corne-Case-Accesorie-Design/tree/main/Flattened%20Wrist%20Rest%20Shape%20Printout) and print out both the right and left sheets. These sheets are a flattened version of the surface of the wrist rest. You will use these sheets to cut the shape out of the leather. Place one of the sheets on top of the leather and, with your Exacto Knife, cut out the shape of the wrist rest by tracing the edge on the page. Make sure to hold down the leather to avoid slipping and miscuts. After you are done, you should have a cutout roughly the size of the wrist rest. You can now stick it onto the wrist rest by taking off the adhesive page on the back (assuming you are using the leather sheet recommended; if not, you can glue it onto the wrist rest). If it is too small, try to center it on the wrist rest to avoid it looking off; if too long, center it on the wrist rest and trim off the edges.

10) Congrats on your new keyboard! Have fun!
