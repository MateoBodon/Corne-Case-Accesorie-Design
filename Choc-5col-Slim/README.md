# Slim Variant - Magnetic Cases for the Typeractive Corne

## Introduction

The slim variant of the magnetic cases for the Typeractive Corne is designed with minimalism and portability in mind. Utilizing a smaller 110mAh battery, the case thickness is set at 16mm, while the carrying case measures 17.25mm. Please note, the Slim Variant is incompatible with display covers (e.g., the Typeractive Corne Display Cover available at [typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover](https://typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover)) to maintain its sleek profile.

## Instructions

1. **Print all needed parts** either with your own printer or a printing service. 
   - **Printing Instructions:**
     - No supports are needed for any of the parts.
     - A .16 layer height is recommended for the keyboard case and carrying case (although any layer height should work).
     - An infill percentage between 30-50 percent is recommended for the keyboard case and carrying case, (any infill percentage should work however 30-50 makes the prints feel more sturdy. If you wish to make it sturdier, print at an infill percentage higher than 50 at the cost of time and materials).
     - Make sure to orient the carrying case so that the flat side is facing down, the walls should be facing up.
     - When printing the wrist rest, a infill percentage of 50% and higher is recommended due to the incline of the wrist rest; lower infill percentages can lead to artifacting on the incline. A higher infill percentage also makes the wrist rest feel sturdier. (I personally print it at 80% infill).
     - When printing the wrist rest, choose a smaller layer height of between .08 and .12 for a more natural incline with less bumps. (I personally print it at .08 layer height). If your printing software allows for variable layer heights, I recommend that option for the wrist rest (ex. Bambu lab).

2. **Prepare a safe space** to glue your magnets into their holes. You may want to use a piece of parchment paper to prevent glue from getting on your surface. Wearing disposable gloves during the process is suggested.

3. **Inserting magnets into the keyboard case**: Start with the keyboard case and using a small tip for your super glue, insert a few drops into a hole and push the magnet inside. Be careful not to have the other magnets nearby as they may push the magnet out of the hole. Try to avoid getting glue on the plastic; if it does occur, quickly use a paper towel to dab it up. Allow each magnet to sit for about 20 seconds before moving onto the next one. Tip: It is possible to use other magnets on the outside of the keyboard case to guide the magnet into the hole.

4. **Placing magnets on the outside of the keyboard case**: Place 19 magnets in the case so you should have 15 on the outside. Skip placing corresponding magnets to the 4 on the bottom middle of the keyboard case (these are used exclusively for the wrist rest).

5. **Aligning and inserting magnets into the carrying case**: Grab the corresponding side's carrying case and position it in the same orientation as the keyboard case so that the magnet positions align. One by one, grab magnets off of the keyboard case and place them into their corresponding hole on the carrying case. It's crucial to ensure the magnets are facing the correct direction to attract each other.

6. **Allow all the magnets to set**: Complete both the left and right sides. The process for the wrist rest is very similar.

7. **Finalizing the wrist rest magnets**: Place 10 magnets on the bottom exterior of the keyboard case, ensuring each one aligns with an interior magnet. Then, position your wrist rest in the same orientation as the keyboard case, making sure it aligns, and follow the same process of taking the magnets and gluing them into their corresponding holes on the wrist rest.

Congratulations, the hard part is over, and your magnets are all inserted!
