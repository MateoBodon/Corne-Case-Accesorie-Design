## Introduction

Welcome to the repository hosting my magnetic keyboard case designs for the Typeractive Corne keyboard. In this collection, you'll discover innovative solutions tailored to enhance your mechanical keyboard experience. Below is a list of the designs available, offered in both slim and thick variants:

- A magnetic keyboard case
- A magnetic carrying case
- A magnetic wrist rest

These designs are specifically made for the 5 column Choc keyboard, with plans to accommodate other sizes in the future.

## Attributions

This project would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of several key individuals in the keyboard community. Special thanks to:

- **Jonathan Hsu (Jyojoh)** - For his invaluable assistance with prototyping and design. Jonathan's own collection of case designs serves as a great resource for enthusiasts and can be found [here](https://github.com/jyojoh/case-designs/tree/main).

- **Nick Winans** - The founder of Nice-Keyboards and the creator of the Typeractive Corne. Learn more about his contributions [here](https://github.com/Nicell).

- **Kosuke Adachi** - The original creator of the Corne Keyboard. Kosuke's pioneering work laid the foundation for this project and many others within the community. His GitHub profile can be found [here](https://github.com/foostan).

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of choosing, downloading, and preparing the STL files for printing. We offer designs in both Slim and Thick variants to cater to different preferences and requirements.

### Choosing Your Variant

- **Slim Variants**: Designed for minimalism and portability, the Slim Variant utilizes a smaller 110mAh battery. The case thickness is 16mm, and the carrying case measures 17.25mm. Please note, the Slim Variant is incompatible with display covers (e.g., the Typeractive Corne Display Cover available at [typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover](https://typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover)) to maintain its sleek profile.
  
- **Thick Variants**: Built for extended use and durability, the Thick Variant incorporates a larger 1000mAh battery embedded within the case. It measures 21mm for the case and 25.25mm for the carrying case, offering more room for additional components.

### Battery Life Expectations

The battery life varies significantly between the Slim and Thick variants, especially when using a nice!view display:

- **Slim Variant Battery Life**:
  - Central Board: Approximately 1 week and 6 days (±3 days)
  - Peripheral: Approximately 2 months and 3 weeks (±3 weeks)

- **Thick Variant Battery Life**:
  - Central Board: Approximately 3 months and 1 week (±4 weeks)
  - Peripheral: Approximately 10 months and 3 weeks (±3 months)

### STL Files and Preparation

We have provided the STL files for all parts required to assemble the cases. Below you will find links to the Slim and Thick variants of the cases. Choose the variant that best suits your needs and follow the printing instructions provided within each folder.
