## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of choosing, downloading, and preparing the STL files for printing. We offer designs in both Slim and Thick variants to cater to different preferences and requirements.

### Materials List

#### Shared:

- **Magnets (88 required)**: Used to hold the keyboard case and carrying case together, and to hold the keyboard case and wrist rest together. It's crucial to get these exact magnets if possible, as magnet strength varies and the parts have been designed with these magnets in mind. If not available, make sure to use 6mm by 2mm round magnets and adjust the count as needed for strength. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XRQ44VC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I suggest purchasing more than the required amount as it is easy to mess up the alignment, requiring you to restart.

- **Rubber Feet (16 required)**: The keyboard case and wrist rest have indentations in the bottom meant for these rubber feet. [Purchase here](https://keeb.io/products/skuf-silicone-rubber-keyboard-feet).

 - **Super Glue**: Essential for securing the magnets in their designated slots. The recommended glue is Starbond EM-150 Medium, known for its strong hold. However, application can be tricky due to its flow; it's hard to control how much comes out, and excess glue tends to ooze out when not in use. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/Starbond-EM-150-Medium-Premium-Cyanoacrylate/dp/B00C32MHJU/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1IH3AFUNRCKYB&keywords=ca+glue&qid=1708881751&sprefix=ca+glue%2Caps%2C114&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1). Additional products under testing for ease of application and control include (Will update my recommendation after use):
    - **Loctite Super Glue**: Offers strong adhesion with better control over the flow, appearing to be a strong contender for ease of use. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HUJCQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1).
    - **Bob Smith Glue/Activator Combo**: Also looks promising for both control and hold, potentially offering a more user-friendly application process. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0166FFCHS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1).

- **Disposable Gloves**: Recommended for when gluing magnets as it can get a bit messy. These can be found on Amazon, local stores, or other online retailers.

- **Parchment Paper**: Also recommended for the gluing process to prevent the glue from sticking to your work surface. Available at Amazon, local grocery stores, or craft stores.
- 
- **Leather Sheet**: If you choose to apply a leather sheet on your wrist rest for enhanced aesthetics and comfort. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N68MVZD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

- **Exacto Knife**: Essential for precision cutting of the wrist rest shapes out of the leather. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/Fiskars-Exacto-Precision-Crafts-Protective/dp/B001A42CTW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=CM9VH09RUSUL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8j86bI_Zi8ezuZOCqkUu1sgSa9DDY7OfWpEg97C5b-vxO8B1ezW1UrEO_zXiqWOSXeFqQ9tHsVxOqMzeqUZcb1W-sTdY5seew0IydFs7MfE-SymB2MvQUImWFg1lcSAUaqvLaRkpnBT8gdUqOT9EAqm7X1pYc7E9FdmGtF9sBT4sRJngOfWgJy2WIYPUIAm80T_fOwQDueM3Kep9SSxKg0iF9U-XuvCUuL2o7N6mdg5aviNGt1U1hWuE_nf_Z0HWFSXPq8XJxDD0ThJJj1fJdbFv_yAShK4UZdyZMgnLzyg.ecUdeAFBLCcB15R2KXQalXP9zRTVURHRvh49j7GK9vQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=xacto+knife&qid=1708886636&sprefix=xacto+knife%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1).

#### Slim Variant Exclusive:

- **110mAh 301230 Battery (2 required)**: Ensure the size of your battery matches the 301230 dimensions (30mm x 12mm x 3mm). [Purchase here](https://typeractive.xyz/products/lithium-battery-110mah?variant=43294731665639).

- **Standoff and Screws**: You most likely won’t need these assuming you got your keyboard from Typeractive, as it already comes with the necessary screws and standoffs. [Purchase here if needed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9X1KY6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

#### Thick Variant Exclusive:

- **Soldering Iron**: Required for the construction of the Thick Variant.

- **Heatset Inserts and Tools**: Due to the thickness of the case, heatset inserts are used to create a thread for the standoffs. [Purchase inserts here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MTS6ZZQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). [Purchase tools here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MTS6ZZQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1).

- **Standoffs and Screws**: Used for attaching the board to the heatset inserts. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9X1KY6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

- **1000mAh 523450 Battery (2 required)**: Ensure the size of your battery matches 523450 dimensions (52mm x 34mm x 5mm), and the battery lead should be about as long as the battery itself. [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BTHH72G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Now that you're familiar with the materials required for both variants, let's move on to choosing your variant and preparing for assembly.

### Choosing Your Variant

- **Slim Variants**: Designed for minimalism and portability, the Slim Variant utilizes a smaller 110mAh battery. The case thickness is 16mm, and the carrying case measures 17.25mm. Please note, the Slim Variant is incompatible with display covers (e.g., the Typeractive Corne Display Cover available at [typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover](https://typeractive.xyz/products/corne-display-cover)) to maintain its sleek profile.
  
- **Thick Variants**: Built for extended use and durability, the Thick Variant incorporates a larger 1000mAh battery embedded within the case. It measures 21mm for the case and 25.25mm for the carrying case, offering more room for additional components.

### Battery Life Expectations

The battery life varies significantly between the Slim and Thick variants, especially when using a nice!view display:

- **Slim Variant Battery Life**:
  - Central Board: Approximately 1 week and 6 days (±3 days)
  - Peripheral: Approximately 2 months and 3 weeks (±3 weeks)

- **Thick Variant Battery Life**:
  - Central Board: Approximately 3 months and 1 week (±4 weeks)
  - Peripheral: Approximately 10 months and 3 weeks (±3 months)
