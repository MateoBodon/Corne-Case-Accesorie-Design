# Magnetic Cases for the Typeractive Corne

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository hosting innovative designs for the Typeractive Corne keyboard. This project is dedicated to those who seek a blend of functionality and aesthetics for their corne keyboards. Here, you'll find designs for a series of magnetic parts designed to enhance your typing experience and keyboard's portability. Our initial release includes:

- A magnetic keyboard case
- A magnetic carrying case
- A magnetic wrist rest

These designs are specifically crafted for the 5 column Choc keyboard, with plans to expand our offerings to accommodate other sizes in the future.
